This repository documents pitfalls or hardships I've found when I was playing around with RUST. However, my playground is not public and would be too messy. 

The following snippets can help you here:
- [passwordHashing.rs - pbkdf2 implementation of passwordHashing & RustCrypto crate](passwordHashing.rs)
- [Examples for SQLite 3.35+ and Diesel PR 3004 returning clause](diesel_returning_clause_sqlite335.md) 
- [How to install Rust,Docker,SQlite 3.35+ ?](rust_sqlite_335_bookworm_docker.md)
